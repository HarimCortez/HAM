# ham-backend-engineer — conventions from slices S1 (platform skeleton) + S3a (identity/authz/audit)

## Environment gotcha (UPDATED in S3a — the S1 note below is stale)
As of S3a, this sandbox **does** have a working Django/Postgres/pytest toolchain: a real
venv at `/home/user/HAM/.venv/bin/` (`python`, `mypy`, with django-stubs installed —
prefer this mypy over `/root/.local/bin/mypy`, which lacks `mypy_django_plugin`), and a local
Postgres 16 already running on 5432 with trust auth. `pip`/`uv` install *do* work now (network
egress is available) — don't assume the S1-era block still applies. Give each parallel slice
its own database (e.g. `ham_s3a`) so worktrees don't collide; `pytest-django` creates
`test_<dbname>` automatically. Run tests with, e.g.:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/ham_s3a PYTHONPATH=. /home/user/HAM/.venv/bin/python -m pytest
```
`ruff`/`ruff format` still resolve fine from `/root/.local/bin/` (no django-stubs dependency).
Always verify a real green `pytest`/`mypy` run before claiming tests passed.

## S3a additions: identity, authz, audit
- **Dependency layering (import-linter, `pyproject.toml`):** `ham.web` -> `ham.identity` ->
  `ham.authz` -> `ham.audit` -> `ham.outbox` -> `ham.platform` -> `ham.rules`. Only
  `ham.identity` may read auth tables (`User`, `RoleAssignment`, `ImpersonationSession`);
  everything else takes an `ActorContext` (`ham/authz/context.py`).
- **Breaking the authz<->audit cycle:** `ham.authz.commands.command()` must call
  `ham.audit.services.record()` and `ham.outbox.api.emit()` (authz depends on audit/outbox),
  but `ham.audit`'s viewer/export need authorization checks too — which would import back
  into `ham.authz` and violate the layer. Resolution: `ham.audit.queries`/`ham.audit.export`
  are **pure, ctx-free** data/formatting functions with no authorization; the *authorized*
  entry point views must call is `ham.authz.audit_access` (imports both, sits above both).
  `ham.authz.commands` doesn't import `ham.audit`/`ham.outbox` at module scope either — it
  reads module-level globals (`_audit_record`, `_outbox_emit`) that `AuthzConfig.ready()`
  (`ham/authz/apps.py`) registers at Django startup. If you add a new cross-package call in
  this area, check `lint-imports` before assuming it'll work — the layering is easy to
  accidentally violate with an innocent-looking import.
- **The one write path** (`@command("action.code")`, `ham/authz/commands.py`): wraps a service
  fn that returns a `CommandResult` (value + audit fields + optional `OutboxSpec`). Order:
  authorize -> (audit `authz.denied` if in `_AUDITED_ON_DENIAL` and denied) -> impersonation
  block (audits `impersonation.action_blocked`) -> step-up freshness -> `transaction.atomic()`
  wrapping the fn call + `audit.record()` + `outbox.emit()`. An exception anywhere inside the
  atomic block rolls back the DB change, the audit event, and the outbox emit together —
  that's the actual mechanism the "atomic rollback" tests rely on, not anything bespoke.
- **`ham/outbox/` is an S4 stub** (`ham/outbox/api.py`): in-memory list, `emit()` /
  `events()` / `clear()`. Do not add models there; S4 replaces the whole file. Tests call
  `outbox_api.clear()` in an autouse-style fixture to avoid cross-test leakage of the
  module-level list.
- **RoleAssignment invariants** are enforced by Postgres CHECK + two partial unique
  `UniqueConstraint`s (see `ham/identity/models.py`), not just Python — test invariant
  violations with `pytest.raises(IntegrityError)` inside `with transaction.atomic():` (a
  failed statement poisons the outer transaction otherwise, breaking later assertions in the
  same test).
- **`AuditEvent` append-only** is enforced twice: Python-level (`save()`/`delete()` raise
  `AppendOnlyError`) as a friendly error for application code, and a Postgres trigger
  (`ham/audit/migrations/0002_append_only_triggers.py`) as the real control (blocks raw SQL
  too). The purge escape hatch is `SET LOCAL ham.audit_purge = 'on'` — note `SET LOCAL` is
  scoped to the enclosing *real* transaction, not a savepoint, so a test asserting "the flag
  doesn't leak to the next transaction" needs `@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)` to get
  real transaction boundaries instead of pytest-django's default single wrapping transaction.
- **Citext email**: `User.email` uses a custom `CIEmailField` (`db_type` returns `"citext"`)
  plus `CREATE EXTENSION citext` as the first operation of `ham/identity/migrations/0001_initial.py`
  (needs `django.contrib.postgres` in `INSTALLED_APPS` for the `CreateExtension` operation).
- **Custom `AUTH_USER_MODEL = "identity.User"`**: no usable password
  (`set_unusable_password()` in the manager), no `PermissionsMixin` (HAM's own matrix is the
  only authority — don't mix in Django's groups/permissions). django-stubs is picky about
  `REQUIRED_FIELDS`/`USERNAME_FIELD` re-declarations on `AbstractBaseUser` subclasses — don't
  add a type annotation to `REQUIRED_FIELDS = []` (`mypy` treats an annotated Model-class
  assignment as a field and it conflicts with the base class's `ClassVar`).
- **Docs generation, `build_tokens`-style**: `ham/authz/docgen.py` renders
  `docs/architecture/permission-matrix.md` from `ham/authz/matrix.py`;
  `manage.py build_permission_matrix [--check]` mirrors `build_tokens`. Regenerate after any
  matrix change and commit the `.md` file — CI and a pytest test both check it's not stale.
- **Management command ownership**: a command belongs with the app whose service it calls, not
  wherever it happened to be scaffolded first. `bootstrap_admin` moved from
  `ham.platform.management.commands` (S1 stub) to `ham.identity.management.commands` in S3a
  once `ham.identity` existed, because `ham.platform` (bottom layer) must never import a
  domain module — even via a deferred/lazy import inside a function body. import-linter's
  static analysis flags an import statement regardless of nesting; "lazy import to dodge a
  circular import" only helps at runtime, never with the linter.

## Repo layout (S1)
- `config/settings/{base,dev,test,prod}.py` — 12-factor, django-environ. `HAM_ENV` (not just
  `DEBUG`) gates prod-only guardrails (admin mount, seed refusal) so a staging box with
  `DEBUG=False` doesn't accidentally get treated as prod.
- `ham/platform/` — Clock (`clock.py`), UUIDv7 (`ids.py`, `UUID7Field`), PII log scrubber
  (`logging.py`), brand loader (`brand.py`), church profile model+service (`models.py`,
  `church.py`), context processor, env guard (`env.py::refuse_in_production`).
- `ham/jobs/` — the ONLY module that imports `procrastinate` directly (`job()`, `defer()`,
  `defer_later()`, `queue_lag_seconds()`). Domain code must import `ham.jobs`, never
  `procrastinate` itself.
- `ham/web/` — app shell placeholder; currently just `/healthz`.
- `ham/rules/` — owned by ham-rules-engineer. Never create/edit files there; only an empty
  `__init__.py` placeholder if it doesn't exist yet.
- Management commands live under `ham/platform/management/commands/` (`build_tokens`, wraps
  `design-system/tools/build_tokens.py`) and, since S3a, `ham/identity/management/commands/`
  (`bootstrap_admin`, `seed_dev`) and `ham/authz/management/commands/`
  (`build_permission_matrix`) — put a command with the app whose service it calls, not
  `ham.platform` (see the S3a note above on why `bootstrap_admin` moved there from `platform`).

## Known extension points / gaps for later slices
- **django-allauth is a pyproject dependency but NOT wired into `INSTALLED_APPS`/urls yet** —
  deliberately left to S3b so its models/migrations don't collide with identity work landing in
  parallel. Same for `django-anymail`: `EMAIL_BACKEND` setting exists (console/locmem
  defaults) but no anymail-specific config until S4 builds the adapter.
- **Route guard / `PUBLIC_ROUTES` / `nav_for` exist since S3a** (`ham/authz/guard.py`,
  `ham/authz/nav.py`) but there are almost no real routes yet — S5 builds the actual screens
  and must decorate every view with `@requires_action(...)` or list it in `PUBLIC_ROUTES`, or
  the route-guard middleware fails closed (404) by design.
- **S3b (auth) session-key contract**: `ham/identity/middleware.py` documents the exact
  session keys (`ham_impersonation_id`, `ham_mfa_satisfied`, `ham_step_up_at`) S3b's sign-in/
  MFA/step-up/impersonation flows must read and write so `ActorContext` reflects them.
- **`ham/rules/`, `docs/rules-changelog.md`, `tests/rules/`** are ham-rules-engineer's — do not
  touch; they landed in the same tree concurrently with S1.

## Lint/format setup
- `pyproject.toml` `[tool.ruff]` has `extend-exclude = ["design-system", "frontend", "docs"]`
  because `design-system/tools/build_tokens.py` is UI-designer-owned and uses a different style
  (long lines, etc.) — don't lint it as application code.
- Line length 100. `ruff format` matches `ruff check` expectations; run both.
- mypy uses `django-stubs`; `[tool.django-stubs] django_settings_module = "config.settings.test"`.

## Testing
- `pytest-django`, `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.test` (set in `pyproject.toml`
  `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`).
- `tests/conftest.py` has an autouse fixture that resets `ham.platform.clock` to `SystemClock`
  before/after every test — don't forget to restore the clock in any new time-travel test.
- Postgres for tests: `make dev-db` (via `scripts/dev_db.sh`, initdb+pg_ctl under `./pgdata`,
  trust auth, no Docker) or CI's `postgres:16` service container.

## CI
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`: ruff check, ruff format --check, mypy, `makemigrations --check
--dry-run`, `lint-imports` (import-linter, contract in `pyproject.toml`
`[[tool.importlinter.contracts]]` — now the full `ham.web -> ham.identity -> ham.authz ->
ham.audit -> ham.outbox -> ham.platform -> ham.rules` layering per foundation.md §1; extend
further as modules land), `build_permission_matrix --check`, pytest against a Postgres 16
service, `build_tokens --check`, pip-audit (non-blocking).

## Misc
- `.env.example` **cannot be created**: `.claude/settings.json` denies Read/Write on any
  `.env*` path (including `.env.example`) as a secrets guardrail, even via Bash heredoc.
  Document required env vars in a regular doc instead (see `docs/dev-environment.md`).
